## Figma Design Updates
[Latest Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/0y2M2EpUix6RQ6k6s7rdmn/Portfolio-Design?node-id=0%3A1&t=YS1EtgbiJrcPLH6U-1)
1. **Color Scheme**  
    - Selected new primary color scheme for portfolio considering *Material Design*.  
    - I selected Blue #2196F3 as my primary color due to this color being associated with trust/loyalty/stability.
    - This color is used primarily to highlight the interactive parts of my design such as the navigation bar, projects and contact form. I am going for simple and effective, but I am not sure if I should add in more color.
2. **Navigation Bar**  
    - Changed to a floating style to give more sense of elevation on the page.  
    - Changed to link style buttons and used a thin bar as a "current page" indication. I feel this gives it a cleaner/simpler style.
    - The "Logo" will be close to a square shape. I am still working on a design idea, but I want to use my first initial "D".
3. **Landing Page**  
    - Changed hero image to full-screen with "About Me Summary" and the "Twitter RSS" feed over top and to the left. This gave a cleaner more complete feeling to the page.
4. **Project Page**
    - Added shadow to the "Project Summary Blocks" to give elevation to the surfaces.
5. **About Me Page**
    - Added shadow to profile picture and summary surface for elevation.
6. **Contact Page**
    - Added shadow to Google Map and Contact Form for elevation.
7. **Mobile Design**
    - Added a mobile design with the use of a hamburger style navigation menu for a better landing page display.
    - Added a footer for clear indication of the bottom of the page when scrolling. 

## 5 UX Laws Used
1. **Hick's Law**- "The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices."
    - Takeaway: "Avoid overwhelming users by highlighting recommended options."
        - I use the blue primary coloring to highlight interactive features on the pages.
2. **Jakob's Law**- "Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know."
    - Takeaway: "By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the users can focus on their tasks rather than on learning new models."
        - The overall design of the portfolio is a style commonly found on the web. This allows the user to navigate with ease and to focus on my projects and skill.
3. **Law of Common Region**- "Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary."
    - Takeaway: "Common region creates a clear structure and helps users quickly and effectively understand the relationship between elements and sections."
        - The use of backgrounds and borders on the pages helps users to understand the sections.
4. **Law of Similarity**- The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated.
    - Takeaway: "Ensure that links and navigation systems are visually differentiated from normal text elements."
        - The use of blue surfaces and white text for links makes the distinction clear.
5. **Law of Uniform Connectedness**- "Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection."
    - Takeaway: "Group functions of a similar nature so they are visually connected via colors, lines, frames, or other shapes."
        - The navigation bar links and the project summary blocks are visually connected with color and shapes.
